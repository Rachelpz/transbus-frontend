## Briefing

The Service Control System called TransBus System is a web application made up of a front-end and a back-end. The front-end is developed from Java Server Faces (JSF) and Spring using Maven. The back - end with REST API is made in Spring framework (Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA) with database (postgresql) and swagger, developed with the Maven compilation system. The project deals mainly with the administration of transport and services.
Although the app is generally usable, keep in mind that this is work in progress. Some bugs probably exist, some features are missing. The app was tested in the latest Firefox only.

## Installing and running

This is _NOT_ a standalone app, this is just a frontend, a client. It requires a [backend](https://github.com/Rachelpz/transbus_backend).

## Internationalization

The app is fully internationalized. The UI language is selected automatically from the language specified by the browser.

The app is currently available in the following languages:
 * English
 * Spanish
 
 ## Responsive design
